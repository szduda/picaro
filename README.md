## Setup wifi connection
In the root repo directory create `.env` file. The first line should contain the SSID of the Wi-Fi network you want to connect to. In the second line put your password. By default this file won't and should never be uploaded to any version control system like GitHub.

An example file would look like:
```txt
ssid
pA$$w0rd
```
